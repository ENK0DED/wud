**What's up Docker** ( _aka WUD_ ) is a tool which lets you notify as soon as an new version of a Docker image you use can be updated.  

It periodically watches you Docker hosts to:

?> **Detect** which images you use

?> **Find** which images could be updated

?> **Trigger** actions to let you react the way you want

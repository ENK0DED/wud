WUD supports many registries:
- [ACR (Azure Container Registry)](registries/acr/)
- [ECR (Amazon Elastic Container Registry)](registries/ecr/)
- [GCR (Google Container Registry)](registries/gcr/)
- [HUB (Docker Hub incl private repositories)](registries/hub/)

!> By default, WUD is working _out-of-the-box_ with public images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

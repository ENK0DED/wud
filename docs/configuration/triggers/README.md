## Triggers

Triggers are responsible for performing actions when a new image is found.
  
Triggers are enabled using environment variables.

```bash
WUD_TRIGGER_{{ trigger_type }}_{{trigger_name }}_{{ trigger_configuration_item }}=XXX
```

See the subsection to discover which triggers are implemented and how to use them.
